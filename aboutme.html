  <h1>Career Goal</h1>
  <p> My future goal once I graduate frrom highschool is to either become a software engineer or to do something to do with computers. I have opted to take computer science principles in order to learn how to code. I plan to go to college to further pursue computer science. I would like to work from home coding as it seems like the most enjoyable job.  </p>
  <h1>Personal Qualities</h1>
  <p> To begin with my name is Ryan Frink Sobierajski. Quite a mouthful I know. I am a currently a Junior at Palm Desert Highschool. 
       I am enrolled in mostly Ap and Honors classes and am on the schools track team. I am a hard worker which leads into me being a perfect group leader. I typically take the position of leader in group activites opting 
      to lead rather than follow which leads to me being very social and capable of working in a group setting.
  </p>
 <p> I take running and school very seriously. I run the 400 meter and have currently run a fifty three second 400 meter which is my proudest accomplishment as of late. I am a very independent and am very capable of solving problems on my own. Im well versed in computers as I have been around them my entire life. Lastly I am good at managing my time and workload which comes from taking many AP classes.
 </p>
 <h1>Conclusion</h1>
 <p> To conclude I am sixteen years old highschooler who is very independent and a group leader. I believe these skills will help me a lot later on in life and am excited for my future.
